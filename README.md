# PowerLoadForecasting
# Using LSTM neural network to forecast the hourly power load
We try to incorporate the historical hourly power load observations into the model development. 
When training the LSTM model, we use the observations from previous 3 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours as inputs and implement the algorithms from the Keras LSTM package.
